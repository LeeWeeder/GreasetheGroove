# Grease the Groove

A simple Android application to help you train Grease the Grooveâ€”a training technique where you spam an exercise across the whole duration of a day.

### What this does
1. Automatically calculates the appropriate reps per set based on your max reps and rest time.
2. Notifies you when a set should be done.
3. Automatically increase your reps for next set based on the RPE of the previous set.
